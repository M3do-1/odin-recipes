            <li>Step 1: Marinate the chicken: In a large bowl, mix yogurt, turmeric, chili powder, and salt. Add chicken and coat well. Set aside for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Heat oil in a large pan and fry onions until golden brown. Remove half for garnish and set aside.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Add garlic and ginger paste to the pan and sauté for 1 minute. Add marinated chicken and cook until no longer pink, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 4: In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, cumin seeds, and salt. Stir in soaked rice and cook until 70% done, then drain.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Layer the biryani: Spread half of the cooked rice in a large pot. Add the chicken mixture, fresh cilantro, mint, and the remaining rice. Drizzle with saffron milk and top with fried onions.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Cover the pot tightly and cook on low heat (dum method) for 25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
