            <li>Step 1: Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and bell peppers, and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 2: Stir in garlic, cumin, paprika, and chili powder, cooking for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Step 3: Add the canned tomatoes with their juices. Break them up with a spoon and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

            <li>Step 6: Serve hot with crusty bread for dipping.</li>
