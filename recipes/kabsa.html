    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kabsa is a flavorful, aromatic dish of rice, meat, vegetables, and spices that originated in the Gulf of Arabia</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
        <li>3 carrots, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>2 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground coriander</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups hot water, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups unrinsed basmati rice</li>
        <li>¼ cup raisins</li>
        <li>¼ cup toasted slivered almonds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Step 1: Make spice mix: Stir together saffron, cinnamon, allspice, lime powder, cardamom, and white pepper in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Make dish: Melt butter in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in butter until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add chicken and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato purée.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Stir in canned tomatoes with juice, carrots, cloves, nutmeg, cumin, coriander, salt, black pepper, and reserved spice mix. Cook for about 3 minutes; pour in water and add chicken bouillon cube.</li>
        <li>Step 4: Bring sauce to a boil, then reduce heat, and cover the pot. Simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Gently stir in rice. Cover the pot and simmer until rice is tender and almost dry, about 25 minutes; add raisins and a little more hot water, if necessary. Cover and cook until rice grains separate, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Transfer rice to a large serving platter and arrange chicken on top. Sprinkle with toasted slivered almonds.</li>
